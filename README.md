Metrics Machine 2 Space Center
==============================

![](MM2SS.gif)

This extension generates a list of words in Robofont’s Space Center based on the current pair you’re kerning in the [Metrics Machine] extension by Tal Leming.

The wonderful [word-o-mat] extension by Nina Stössinger was a major influence, and this would most certainly not exist if Nina’s word-o-mat hadn’t come first. And thanks to Stephen Nixon for asking about something like this, which encouraged me to share this. I would love to see this extension evolve to have nice menus and an interface as powerful as word-o-mat someday.

Pull requests are greatly appreciated 🙏
